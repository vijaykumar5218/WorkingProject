No matter how close or far away your\r\n                                retirement is, how much you can save for it will be dependent to some extent on your\r\n                                current financial situation. &quot;Organize my $$$&quot; lays out multiple aspects of your\r\n                                financial picture, even including household data, in a digital &quot;Personal Financial\r\n                                Dashboard&quot;, which enables you to monitor a consolidated picture of your overall\r\n                                financial health in one multi-view status report. The &quot;Organize My $$$&quot; dashboard is a\r\n                                component of a holistic planning process that can help you explore your savings options\r\n                                and design and manage your plan, as well as providing access to recommendations that are\r\n                                tailored to fit your particular needs and goals. Please note myOrangeMoney is separate\r\n                                from “Organize my $$$”. As a result, the information you enter under “Organize my $$$”\r\n                                will not carry over to myOrangeMoney.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse\r\n                            heading-text=&quot;What if I have multiple plans with the same employer on your system?&quot;\r\n                        &gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                In the majority of cases, all plans under the same employer on Voya’s recordkeeping\r\n                                system will be included in your myOrangeMoney estimate.

Be sure to obtain a current prospectus for any mutual fund\r\n                                investment choices available to you. A prospectus will contain information about the\r\n                                risks, charges, and expenses of the mutual fund. Read and consider it carefully before\r\n                                investing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;b&gt;Investment Analysis Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Any forecasts presented are not a guarantee of\r\n                                future results, but only reasonable estimates. Forecasts are based upon information\r\n                                about you and your current accounts and investments that we know about, estimated annual\r\n                                savings amount and forward-looking models of the economy and securities markets that\r\n                                utilize data such as historical returns, historical correlations, expected growth rates,\r\n                                and calculated risk premiums. Since past performance is not an accurate predictor of the\r\n                                future and reliance on historical and current data necessarily involves inherent\r\n                                limitations, you must understand that the estimates are only a tool to be used in\r\n                                evaluating your retirement portfolio. Forecast amounts are in today&#39;s dollars, which\r\n                                means that they have been adjusted for inflation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                Forecasts are created by generating thousands of hypothetical future economic scenarios\r\n                                to evaluate how an investment portfolio might perform under a variety of circumstances,\r\n                                including changing interest rates, inflation, and market conditions.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;b&gt;About Your Information:&lt;/b&gt; If your portfolio includes an account or your other\r\n                                income includes a benefit that may not be fully funded (e.g., a non-qualified deferred\r\n                                compensation plan or a pension plan), we do not provide an assessment of the risk or\r\n                                degree of underfunding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                If your portfolio includes assets invested in a self-directed brokerage option or\r\n                                account, you need to enter that information directly through Online Advice and identify\r\n                                the underlying investments. Alternatively you can speak with a VRA Advisor who can input\r\n                                those details for you. You can reach a VRA Advisor through your plan’s toll free number.\r\n                                Once the account has been entered via Online Advice or a VRA Advisor, you will see it\r\n                                reflected in your myOrangeMoney monthly income estimates.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                If you own investments that you or your employer did not tell us about or that we were\r\n                                unable to model, we do not analyze those investments and they are not included in the\r\n                                analysis. If you are relying on a generic fund to represent an asset that we are unable\r\n                                to model (i.e. private stocks or funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, etc.), that fund is\r\n                                included in our analysis but is not a perfect substitute for your actual investment.\r\n                                Loan balances (if any) are not included in your total account balance or our analysis.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                While we will attempt to update security prices daily and monitor your investments for\r\n                                the various corporate actions that may occur (i.e. splits, mergers), it is ultimately\r\n                                your responsibility to inform us of any changes to your investments. We rely on\r\n                                information provided by you as well as information we have from your plan sponsor to\r\n                                create your forecast. If you have provided spouse or partner information, we rely on\r\n                                that information as well. If you wish to learn about the assumptions we used or to\r\n                                confirm that your information is accurate, please call your plan’s toll free number and\r\n                                ask to speak with a VRA Advisor.

In general, if you hold any investments that cannot be\r\n                                reallocated by you, we model those investments on a “buy and hold” basis, rather than\r\n                                assuming that you will adjust their proportions over time.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;u&gt;If you are enrolled in the Professional Management program&lt;/u&gt;\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                The estimated value of your investments assumes participation in the Professional\r\n                                Management program until retirement and also includes any additional investments you or\r\n                                your employer may have told us about and any employer contribution.

If contributions to your accounts exceed a\r\n                                collective limit, your estimated savings amount may be overstated. As a result, your\r\n                                portfolio and retirement income estimates may also be overstated.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                Additional considerations:\r\n                                &lt;ul class=&quot;bulletList&quot;&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;\r\n                                        If your plan is subject to contribution limits imposed under Puerto Rico law, we\r\n                                        consider those limits as well.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        We take into consideration any plan rule that we know about that allows your\r\n                                        pre-tax (and Roth, if applicable) contributions to continue, for example, as age\r\n                                        50+ catch-up contributions or after-tax contributions once those contributions\r\n                                        reach the IRS limit for the year.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        If you participate in an automatic savings program, future increases to your\r\n                                        contributions are not considered.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n                                Current pay and contribution amounts used to calculate your income estimate, in\r\n                                myOrangeMoney, are limited based on laws that govern retirement plans, such as how much\r\n                                money can be contributed annually on a before-tax basis. The maximum annual pay that may\r\n                                be considered in the tool is also constrained by compensation limits that are set\r\n                                annually by the IRS, [(IRC Section 401(a)(17)]. Amounts in excess of the IRC limits are\r\n                                not considered in myOrangeMoney when determining how much you can defer as a percent of\r\n                                salary each year. For example, if the current IRC limit is $270,000 and your pay is\r\n                                $300,000, only the first $270,000 of your pay would be considered as a basis for\r\n                                contributions. So, in this scenario, if your stated contribution were 6 % of annual pay,\r\n                                the deferral amount would be $16,200 per year, not $18,000.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;b&gt;Contributions are assumed to Continue:&lt;/b&gt; When we estimate your retirement income\r\n                                values and portfolio values, we generally assume contributions (if any) continue until\r\n                                retirement. Sometimes a plan rule may call for employer contributions to cease or change\r\n                                on a specified future date. If we know about that plan rule, we take that into\r\n                                consideration when estimating your retirement income values. If you have specified\r\n                                contributions to an account that are dependent upon a salary from a job with a future\r\n                                start date, your forecasts assume that those contributions start on the specified date.\r\n                                Any changes in employer contributions may affect your forecast estimate.\r\n                                &lt;b&gt;Contributions to an Account with a $0 Balance:&lt;/b&gt; When we estimate your retirement\r\n                                income values and portfolio values, contributions, if any, to an account with a $0\r\n                                balance are not included.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse heading-text=&quot;Can I model catchup contribution if I’m under 50?&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                Catchup contributions can only be modeled if you are currently eligible to make them or\r\n                                will be eligible to make them in the current calendar year.

By\r\n                                confirming the state in which you plan to live in retirement, we can illustrate the\r\n                                potential expenses you would incur at varying five year increments, starting at age 65.\r\n                                The increase in costs is based on an inflation rate of 6.5% annually and is represented\r\n                                in today’s dollars. This will help you to assess whether your retirement income estimate\r\n                                is adequate to meet your needs as you age. If not, you can consider additional savings\r\n                                options. Note that choosing a state here does not affect the myOrangeMoney retirement\r\n                                income forecast. The 6.5% annual inflation rate assumption is only used in the\r\n                                Retirement Healthcare feature – assumptions used for your retirement income forecast may\r\n                                differ.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse heading-text=&quot;What is Medicare?&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                Medicare is our country’s health insurance program for people age 65 or older (Medicare\r\n                                may also cover people under age 65 with certain disabilities and people of any age with\r\n                                End-Stage Renal Disease). Unless you choose a Medicare Advantage Plan from a private\r\n                                insurer (like an HMO or PPO), you may be entitled to benefits managed by the Federal\r\n                                government including Medicare Part A benefits. You may also elect to purchase Medicare\r\n                                Part B benefits, Part D or prescription drug coverage or Medicare Supplemental Coverage,\r\n                                also referred to as Medigap Coverage. You may experience some additional healthcare\r\n                                related costs not covered by any of these Medicare benefits. Costs associated with Long\r\n                                Term Care needs are not addressed by this experience or estimate. All costs are in\r\n                                current dollars. If you retire before you are eligible for Medicare you may choose to\r\n                                purchase private health insurance or to self-insure. Costs and coverage for private\r\n                                health insurance varies greatly and are not estimated with this tool.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                Different parts of Medicare cover different services.

Medicare Part A helps cover inpatient care in\r\n                                        hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities\r\n                                        (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some\r\n                                        home health care. Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these\r\n                                        benefits.

Medicare Part B helps cover medically\r\n                                        necessary doctors&#39; services and outpatient care. It also covers some other\r\n                                        medical services that Part A doesn&#39;t cover, such as some of the services of\r\n                                        physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B premiums\r\n                                        are uniform nationally and are increased for those with a higher Modified\r\n                                        Adjusted Gross Income.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        Medicare Part C Supplemental premium or Medigap - Medigap or Medicare Part C\r\n                                        coverage is optional and is provided through insurance policies issues by\r\n                                        private insurers (Plans A-N). You may incur out-of-pocket healthcare expenses,\r\n                                        for costs not covered by Medicare benefits and Medigap insurance.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        Medicare Part D Prescription Drug coverage - Part D coverage is optional.\r\n                                        Premiums are increased for those with a higher Modified Adjusted Gross Income,\r\n                                        differ from state to state, and vary based on the specific plan and level of\r\n                                        benefit selected. Most people will pay a monthly premium for this coverage.\r\n                                        Everyone with Medicare can get this coverage that may help lower prescription\r\n                                        drug costs and help protect against higher costs in the future. Medicare\r\n                                        Prescription Drug Coverage is insurance. Private companies provide the coverage.\r\n                                        Beneficiaries choose the drug plan and pay a monthly premium. Like other\r\n                                        insurance, if a beneficiary decides not to enroll in a drug plan when they are\r\n                                        first eligible, they may pay a penalty if they choose to join later.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        Out-of-Pocket – This is estimated and refers to healthcare costs not covered by\r\n                                        any of the above plans.

Medicaid is a joint federal and state government program that helps\r\n                                low-income retirees cover healthcare expenses. Each state has its own rules about who is\r\n                                eligible and what is covered under Medicaid. Some people qualify for both Medicare and\r\n                                Medicaid. Medicaid covers most basic health services and many costs not covered by\r\n                                Medicare like prescription drugs, nursing home care, eye exams, glasses, and more.\r\n                                Medicaid may also help to pay for Medicare costs. For more information about the\r\n                                Medicaid program, contact your local medical assistance agency, social services or\r\n                                welfare office.

If you are still working and covered by your employer group health plan,\r\n                                speak to your personnel or benefits office.

Costs associated with Long Term Care needs are not addressed by this\r\n                                experience or estimate. Costs are in current dollars. If you retire before you are\r\n                                eligible for Medicare you may choose to purchase private health insurance or to\r\n                                self-insure. Costs and coverage for private health insurance varies greatly and are not\r\n                                estimated in this experience.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                Different parts of Medicare cover different services. The main parts of Medicare are\r\n                                further summarized below.\r\n                                &lt;ul class=&quot;bulletList&quot;&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;b&gt;Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance&lt;/b&gt; - Most people do not pay a premium in\r\n                                        retirement for Part A if they or a spouse already paid for it through their\r\n                                        payroll taxes while working. Medicare Part A helps cover inpatient care in\r\n                                        hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities\r\n                                        (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some\r\n                                        home health care. Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these\r\n                                        benefits. Note also that co-payments, coinsurance or deductibles may apply.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;b&gt;Medicare Part B Medical or Doctor’s Insurance&lt;/b&gt; - Most people pay a monthly\r\n                                        premium in retirement for Part B. Medicare Part B helps cover medically\r\n                                        necessary doctors&#39; services and outpatient care. It also covers some other\r\n                                        medical services that Part A doesn&#39;t cover, such as some of the services of\r\n                                        physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B premiums\r\n                                        are uniform nationally and are increased for those with a higher Modified\r\n                                        Adjusted Gross Income.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;b&gt;Medicare Part C Supplemental premium or Medigap&lt;/b&gt; - Medigap or Medicare\r\n                                        Part C coverage is optional and is provided through insurance policies issues by\r\n                                        private insurers (Plans A-N). You may incur out-of-pocket healthcare expenses,\r\n                                        for costs not covered by Medicare benefits and Medigap insurance.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;b&gt;Medicare Part D Prescription Drug coverage&lt;/b&gt; - Part D coverage is optional.\r\n                                        Premiums are increased for those with a higher Modified Adjusted Gross Income,\r\n                                        differ from state to state, and vary based on the specific plan and level of\r\n                                        benefit selected. Most people will pay a monthly premium for this coverage.\r\n                                        Everyone with Medicare can get this coverage that may help lower prescription\r\n                                        drug costs and help protect against higher costs in the future. Medicare\r\n                                        Prescription Drug Coverage is insurance. Private companies provide the coverage.\r\n                                        Beneficiaries choose the drug plan and pay a monthly premium. Like other\r\n                                        insurance, if a beneficiary decides not to enroll in a drug plan when they are\r\n                                        first eligible, they may pay a penalty if they choose to join later.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;b&gt;Out-of-Pocket&lt;/b&gt; - This is estimated and refers to healthcare costs not\r\n                                        covered by any of the above plans. Examples of possible costs include dental,\r\n                                        vision, hearing aids, medications not covered by Part D, copays, deductibles or\r\n                                        other services not covered by Medigap.\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;b&gt;Pre-Medicare Supplemental&lt;/b&gt; - If you retire before age 65, you may need to\r\n                                        purchase private health insurance (or self-insure). Costs and coverage vary\r\n                                        greatly.

Medicaid is a joint federal and state government program that helps\r\n                                low-income retirees cover healthcare expenses. Each state has its own rules about who is\r\n                                eligible and what is covered under Medicaid. Some people qualify for both Medicare and\r\n                                Medicaid. Medicaid covers most basic health services and many costs not covered by\r\n                                Medicare like prescription drugs, nursing home care, eye exams, glasses, and more.\r\n                                Medicaid may also help to pay for Medicare costs. For more information about the\r\n                                Medicaid program, contact your local medical assistance agency, social services or\r\n                                welfare office. This feature does not consider whether you will be eligible for Medicaid\r\n                                and estimates Medicare and other retiree health care costs the same way for everyone.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse heading-text=&quot;What if I already have medical insurance?&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                If you already have other health insurance when you become eligible for Medicare, you\r\n                                should consider whether it is worth the monthly premium cost to sign up for Medicare\r\n                                medical insurance. The answer varies with each person and the kind of other health\r\n                                insurance you may have. You should speak with the appropriate resource for your\r\n                                circumstances. If applicable, your employer might also offer services or programs that\r\n                                can help cover or reduce the cost of healthcare in retirement. If you are still working\r\n                                and covered by your employer group health plan, speak to your personnel or benefits\r\n                                office. If you are not covered under an employer plan, reach out to your advisor or\r\n                                insurance agent for assistance. If you expect to have additional income at retirement to\r\n                                cover healthcare related expenses such as a health savings account or a retiree medical\r\n                                account, you can enter it in Other Retirement Savings and Income and it will be included\r\n                                in your income estimate.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse\r\n                            heading-text=&quot;Where do you get my pay to determine my retirement income goal?&quot;\r\n                        &gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                myOrangeMoney uses the compensation amount provided by you or your employer. You can\r\n                                always revise the amount of your pay using the &quot;About Me&quot; button under the display. Be\r\n                                aware that if you revise a salary figure set by your employer, it will only be valid for\r\n                                the current session, and will revert to the employer-provided salary the next time you\r\n                                login to your account. If you have previously used My Retirement Overview (MRO) on the\r\n                                site, any salary you entered into MRO will automatically appear in myOrangeMoney upon\r\n                                your first use.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                Current Pay and contribution amounts used to calculate your income estimate, in\r\n                                myOrangeMoney, are limited based on laws that govern retirement plans, such as how much\r\n                                money can be contributed annually on a before-tax basis. The maximum annual pay that may\r\n                                be considered in the experience is constrained by compensation limits that are set\r\n                                annually by the IRS, [(IRC Section 401(a)(17)]. Amounts in excess of the IRC limits are\r\n                                not considered in myOrangeMoney when determining how much you can defer as a percent of\r\n                                salary each year. For example, if the current IRC limit is $270,000 and your pay is\r\n                                $300,000, only the first $270,000 of your pay would be considered as a basis for\r\n                                contributions. So, in this scenario, if your stated contribution were 6 % of annual pay,\r\n                                the deferral amount would be $16,200 per year, not $18,000.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;b&gt; Please note:&lt;/b&gt; the pay or salary you enter for modeling, will be used when\r\n                                calculating your retirement income goal. For example, if you show an annual pay of\r\n                                $300,000 and an income replacement percentage of 70%, your retirement income goal will\r\n                                be set to 70% of that figure, or $210,000 per year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                myOrangeMoney assumes a 3% annual pay increase but you are always able to change that\r\n                                value in “About Me” under Personal Information.

So, for illustrative purposes, benefit estimates you see in myOrangeMoney\r\n                                will be those that would be available starting at age 62 even if your designated\r\n                                retirement age is younger than age 62. If you were born before 1938, your full\r\n                                retirement age is 65. The full retirement age increases gradually to 67 for people born\r\n                                in 1960 or later.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;i&gt;Collect Benefits Early&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                Some people retire before their full retirement age. You can retire as early as 62 and\r\n                                take benefits at a reduced rate. If you elect to claim benefits early, the result for\r\n                                you (and your spouse, if applicable) could potentially be tens of thousands of dollars\r\n                                in reduced lifetime benefits.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                &lt;i&gt;Collect Benefits Later&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                If you continue to work after your full retirement age, you can receive higher benefits\r\n                                because of additional earnings and credits for delayed retirement. According to the\r\n                                Social Security Administration, the benefit available to you could rise by 6-8% each\r\n                                year that you delay taking your benefit, up to age 70. The amount of the increase\r\n                                depends on the year you were born. If you can wait three years before you collect, you\r\n                                could potentially experience a permanent 24% increase in benefit payments.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                After you turn 70, the amount of your payments is locked in. For illustration purposes,\r\n                                Social Security payment estimates are not modeled beyond age 70.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                If you do not qualify for Social Security benefits on your own, you may be eligible for\r\n                                spousal benefits. You could receive up to 50% of your spouse’s full benefit, even if you\r\n                                have earnings and work history.\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                Due to the complexity of calculating future benefits, these are just rough estimates.\r\n                                More precise benefit estimates are available from the Social Security Administration.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse\r\n                            heading-text=&quot;What if I may be subject to the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)?&quot;\r\n                        &gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) affects how the amount of your retirement\r\n                                benefit is calculated if you receive a pension from work where Social Security taxes\r\n                                were not taken out of your pay. According to the Social Security Administration, if you\r\n                                work for an employer who does not withhold Social Security taxes from your salary, any\r\n                                pension you get based on that work may reduce your Social Security benefits. A modified\r\n                                formula is used to calculate your benefit amount, resulting in a lower Social Security\r\n                                benefit than you otherwise would receive. If you are subject to the WEP, you can use the\r\n                                &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/anyPiaWepjs04.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;\r\n                                    WEP calculator on the Social Security website\r\n                                &lt;/a&gt;\r\n                                to estimate your benefit payments.

If a 3%\r\n                                inflation rate is assumed, this equates to a 3% real rate of return. You may adjust this\r\n                                rate based on your style of investing or if you feel the rate of return for your own\r\n                                investments will be higher or lower than 6%.&lt;i&gt;\r\n                                    Here&#39;s our tip: When designating a rate of return for modeling, consider an average\r\n                                    annual return realized over a period of at least five years if possible, since\r\n                                    retirement investing is generally done over many years. Often there is a display of\r\n                                    your current actual year-to-date rate of return on the retirement plan home page,\r\n                                    located directly below myOrangeMoney. You can also see a longer period rate of\r\n                                    return using the personal rate of return function from the Account menu. You may\r\n                                    adjust the &quot;what my investments may return each year&quot; slider based on your personal\r\n                                    selected investments.&lt;/i\r\n                                &gt;\r\n                                &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n                                It&#39;s important to keep in mind that if you do change the &quot;what my investments may return\r\n                                each year&quot; slider, there is no automatic investment election change or investment fund\r\n                                transfer made on your behalf. If you would like to change the way your future\r\n                                contributions are invested or rebalance your current asset allocation, you must initiate\r\n                                these transactions yourself, selecting the appropriate menu option under the Accounts\r\n                                menu. Also remember that, generally speaking, the greater the return, the greater the\r\n                                risk associated with achieving that return.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse heading-text=&quot;How is my estimate impacted by investment rate of return?&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                For the purposes of the model, the investment rate of return you select and input is\r\n                                assumed to be constant during the period in which your assets accumulate. Any selection\r\n                                you make on the &quot;what my investments may return each year&quot; slider will be reflected in\r\n                                your estimate. For example, if you choose a rate of return above the default 6%, your\r\n                                income estimate will be higher, if you select a return below 6%, your income estimate\r\n                                will be lower. However, it&#39;s very important to keep in mind that investment rates of\r\n                                return you model do not in any way impact the investment selections in your retirement\r\n                                plan, which generally speaking may be affected by market volatility. Monte Carlo\r\n                                probability analysis, which considers the volatility of investment returns over time, is\r\n                                not used in the myOrangeMoney analysis.\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/voya-expand-collapse&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;voya-expand-collapse heading-text=&quot;How is my estimated monthly income calculated?&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                &lt;b&gt;Retirement income estimates&lt;/b&gt; for your current account balance, future\r\n                                contributions from your pay, an income solution (if applicable), and any applicable\r\n                                employer contributions or other assets set aside for retirement are for illustrative\r\n                                purposes only and are not guaranteed. Income estimates are based on the assumption you\r\n                                will make a lump sum purchase of a single life immediate annuity at retirement that pays\r\n                                you a level income amount each month for as long as you live. Using this annuity\r\n                                assumption allows us to translate your estimated retirement portfolio into terms that\r\n                                are similar to other monthly retirement income sources such as Social Security or any\r\n                                pension benefits you may have. The estimated income amount shown is the income you would\r\n                                receive at retirement in terms of today&#39;s dollars, but you should be aware that\r\n                                inflation will erode your spending power over time. For most plans, the estimated amount\r\n                                of the annuity income payment is based on the combination of the Society of Actuaries&#39;\r\n                                Annuity 2000 Basic Mortality Table and a recent 10-year constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities yield rate. This rate fluctuates based on market conditions and is updated at the beginning of each month.\r\n                                Some employers may have provided plan specific annuity rates. If applicable the plan\r\n                                specific information would be located in the Message Center. If you have a guaranteed\r\n                                income solution, that amount will be represented as an estimated future or actual\r\n                                withdrawal amount in View Details. Please keep in mind that this approach to generating\r\n                                your income estimate does not constitute a recommendation to purchase an annuity at\r\n                                retirement. Each individual&#39;s retirement needs are different, and an annuity purchase\r\n                                may or may not make sense for you.\r\n                                &lt;ul class=&quot;bulletList&quot;&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;\r\n                                        The estimates illustrate retirement needs &lt;b&gt;for a single person&lt;/b&gt; and do not\r\n                                        take into account spousal or beneficiary information (unless added in Other\r\n                                        Retirement Savings).\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                        The values displayed have been\r\n                                        &lt;b&gt;rounded to the nearest dollar for display purposes&lt;/b&gt;.
