For example, if you have a $2,000 yearly deductible, you'll need to pay the first $2,000 of your total eligible medical costs before your plan helps to pay.

Dental insurance plans often come with a range of annual limits. Depending on your dental plan, such annual limits can range from as low as $700 or $2,500 per person.
